### Playfair Cipher App for Flutter

This GitHub repository features a Playfair cipher implementation using Flutter, developed as part of a collaborative project. The Playfair cipher is a traditional encryption method that utilizes a 5x5 matrix of letters based on a secret key to encrypt and decrypt messages. This application specifically addresses the frontend implementation of the cipher mechanism, offering an engaging user interface that allows for interactive encryption and decryption processes.

#### Key Features:
- **Interactive Encryption and Decryption**: Users can actively switch between encrypting and decrypting modes, providing immediate feedback and results.
- **Custom Key Input**: Allows users to enter a unique key that dynamically generates a 5x5 Playfair cipher table used for the cryptographic process.
- **Visualization of Cipher Table**: Enhances understanding by displaying the Playfair table, showing how letters are substituted during encryption and decryption.
- **Robust Text Processing**: Ensures accurate handling of text inputs, including letter substitution and error checking, to accommodate various input scenarios.

#### Developer Contribution:
