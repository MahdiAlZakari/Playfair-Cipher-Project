# Playfair-Cipher-Project
A Flutter application that encrypts and decrypts text using the Playfair cipher. Users can input a key to generate a cipher table, then choose to either encrypt plaintext or decrypt ciphertext. The app provides dynamic feedback and a visualization of the cipher table used for encryption/decryption.
